# CRYSTALS COLLECTOR https://bensojka.github.io/Crystals-Collector/

This Crystals Collector game dynamically updates HTML with the jQuery library.

HOW TO PLAY:

There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
Player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When Player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to Player's total score. 
The game will hide this amount until Player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, Player's score counter is updated.

Player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
Player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever Player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, Player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Player's score (and score counter) will also reset to zero.

The app will show the number of games Player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
